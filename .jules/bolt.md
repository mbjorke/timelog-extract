## 2026-07-06 - [Project Classification Optimization]
**Learning:** Project classification `classify_project` was a hot path because it iterated over many profiles and match terms for every single event. Alphanumeric word-boundary matching with `re.search(rf"\b{re.escape(clean)}\b", ...)` is expensive when called thousands of times. Normalizing all terms and using a pre-calculated `word_set` for O(1) membership check is significantly faster and maintains same semantics. Local `match_cache` per `classify_project` call prevents re-evaluating the same term across different profiles.
**Action:** Use set-based word lookups for alphanumeric word-boundary enforcement in high-frequency text classification tasks. Ensure all profile terms are normalized (lowercased/stripped) once and cached.

## 2026-07-08 - [Classification Engine Refinement]
**Learning:** Even with set-based lookups, redundant passes over large profile lists in `classify_project` add measurable overhead. Consolidating "caching" and "ranking" into a single lazy pass reduces total iterations. Additionally, caching *negative* results in the local `match_cache` is critical; otherwise, substring checks are re-run for every profile that shares a non-matching term.
**Action:** Use single-pass lazy evaluation for matching/ranking in hot paths. Ensure local caches explicitly store negative results to prevent redundant expensive checks.

## 2026-07-09 - [Inverted Index for Project Classification]
**Learning:** Project classification was the primary bottleneck because it performed O(N*M) matching (Profiles * Terms) for every event. Moving to an inverted index allows O(U) matching (Unique words in event) for alphanumeric terms. Set intersection between the event's word set and the "fast path" index identifies matches instantly.
**Action:** Use inverted indices for many-to-many matching tasks. Always separate "fast path" (exact/word set) and "slow path" (regex/substring) to minimize expensive operations.

## 2026-07-15 - [Inverted Index for WorkUnit Classification]
**Learning:** `WorkUnit` classification (v2) was performing O(U*S) matching (Units * Signals) per text. Moving to an inverted index allows O(1) matching for alphanumeric signals via set intersection with the text's word set. Using dictionaries for scores/metrics instead of O(N) list allocations per classification further reduces overhead for large unit sets.
**Action:** Use inverted indices for many-to-many matching. Prefer sparse storage (dictionaries) for results when only a small fraction of items are expected to match.
